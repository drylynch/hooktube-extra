fully replaces youtube with a crispy hooktube shell and warm invidious centre.
normal youtube, just faster and tinfoil-friendly.

if a vid doesn't load with the invidio.us embed, it can be switched to native youtube with the 'switch embed' button.
if the vid _still_ doesn't load, you can view it directly on youtube with the 'watch on youtube' button.

all youtube.com links get redirected to hooktube.com! disable the extension temporarily if you wanna use real youtube.
(i'll prob add a neat button to switch between the two without needing to disable at some point)
